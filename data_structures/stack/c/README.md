# Stack With LinkedList Implementation

A Stack is a Data Structure that has the property of Last-In-First-Out(LIFO) with two principal methods, push and pop. 
Push inserts an element at the top of the stack while pop remove the last element inserted on the stack; Both of these operation are 
done in constant time. An additional method called peek serves as way to view the element at the top of the stack without removing it.

To cement the concept of a stack, think of stacking books on top of one another. The way that you would remove a stack of books from one 
another is to constantly remove the top most book until there is no more books to remove. This is the fundamental idea behind a stack.
